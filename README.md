# SCHOOL-REPORT-DASHBOARD
Project Overview
The School Report Project is designed to streamline the collection and analysis of student performance data across different schools. The ultimate goal is to study the student overall performance compare them with influencing factors and analyze the data using Power BI for deeper insights.

#Data Columns
The dataset includes the following columns:

Current school term: Indicates the ongoing school term for the report.
Assessment type: Type of assessment (e.g., mid-term, final, quiz).
Cohort Year: The cohort year of the students being assessed.
ID: Unique identifier for each student.
Name: Student's name.
Fellowship Pathway: Pathway associated with the fellowship or program the student is a part of.
Placement school name: Name of the school where the student is currently placed.
Your Coach: Name of the assigned coach or mentor for the student.
Placement State: State where the placement school is located.
Section taught: The specific section or grade level being taught.
Class: The class the student belongs to.
Class Size: Number of students in the class.
Subject-Specific Data:
Mathematics - Average Score: Average score in Mathematics for the term.

Math grade: Grade calculated for Mathematics.

Maths Average Scores (Male): Average Mathematics score for male students.

Maths Average Scores (Female): Average Mathematics score for female students.

English - Average Score: Average score in English for the term.

English grade: Grade calculated for English.

English Average Scores (Male): Average English score for male students.

English Average Scores (Female): Average English score for female students.

BST - Average Score: Average score in Basic Science and Technology (BST).

BST grade: Grade calculated for BST.

BST Average Scores (Male): Average BST score for male students.

BST Average Scores (Female): Average BST score for female students.

Assessment Participant: Indicates whether the student participated in the assessment.

Additional Calculations
Three new columns were created to calculate grades for the following subjects:

Mathematics
English
Basic Science and Technology (BST)
These grades are calculated based on the average scores in each subject and follow a defined grading scale.

Analysis on Power BI
Power BI was used for analyzing the following aspects:

Subject Performance Trends: Compare the performance across Mathematics, English, and BST for both male and female students.
Class Size Impact: Analyze the effect of class size on student performance.
Gender-based Performance: Review the difference in scores between male and female students in each subject.
Fellowship Pathway Analysis: Track performance based on the fellowship pathways of students and their placement schools.
This project provides key insights into student performance, helping educators identify areas of improvement and success across different schools.
